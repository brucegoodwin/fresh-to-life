                   <b>Tasha Philips - Senior Writer</b> - the freshest thing about working with these women is that we 
                   all get along and love to laugh. We all vibe on the same thing and I love discovering new things with them.
                   Kelly just introduced me to Alicia Bruce and I can't stop playing her album!
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <b>Chanel Williams - Photographer</b> - I am amazed that I get to work with these women! I get paid to photograph
                   the most amazing peole for such an amazing site. I can't believe how much we have grown in such a short amount of time.
                   The feeling I get when I capture the right photo is just euphoric, I can't describe it.
                   Love you all!
                   <br>

                   <b>Kandace Brown - Financial Planner </b> - Being on both sides of the screen really helps not only me but 
                   the rest of the team out and it's great. I get to balance all of the books and then get to write about helping women 
                   out with their financial future. Nothing is better than getting an email or letter after our seminars about how
                   we've really helped someone out. We are all so busy in our lives that taking a few minutes a day to secure a better 
                   is super important. Our readers are so fresh!
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <b>Bryce Matthews - Staff Writer</b> - I get so inspired coming into the office everyday to work with these ladies
                   that my life is so much "Fresher"! We laugh and talk and work! Ha! It's great when work doesn't feel like work, 
                   but that's the point, right?
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <b>Meg Johns - Editorial Analytics Coordinator </b> - As much as I love being at home, I love being with all of these 
                   women. If we could just show a live stream of one of our days in the office! When I'm not sipping a million cups of 
                   coffee, I'm typing up a storm and have 1000 browsers open! Multiple screens for life!
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <b>Jennifer Heard - Staff Writer </b> - I'm a newbie but the ladies here have really made me feel like a sister.
                   The folks we get to write about are so amazing and we usually spend a few hours after the intereviews just chatting!
                   It's a great environment to learn and grow and to stay FRESH!!!
