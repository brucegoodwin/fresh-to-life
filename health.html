                <h2>Fresh Health - the power of fruit</h2>
                
                   <p>Pomegranate is native to a region from Iran to northern India. Pomegranates have been 
                cultivated throughout the Middle East, South Asia, and Mediterranean region for 
                several millennia, and also thrive in the drier climates of California and Arizona.

                 Carbonized exocarp of the fruit has been identified in early Bronze Age levels of Jericho in the 
                 West Bank,
                  as well as late Bronze Age levels of Hala Sultan Tekke on Cyprus and Tiryns. A large, dry pomegranate 
                  was found in the tomb of Djehuty, the butler of Queen Hatshepsut
                  in Egypt; Mesopotamian cuneiform records mention pomegranates from the mid-third millennium BC onwards.

                  It is also extensively grown in South China and in Southeast Asia, whether originally spread along 
                  the route of the Silk Road or brought by sea traders. Kandahar is 
                  famous in Afghanistan for its high-quality pomegranates.

                Although not native to Korea or Japan, the pomegranate is widely grown there and many cultivars have
                been developed. It is widely used for bonsai because of its flowers 
                and for the unusual twisted bark the older specimens can attain. The term "balaustine" (Latin: balaustinus) 
                is also used for a pomegranate-red color.
                Coat of arms of Granada. The ancient city of Granada in Spain was renamed after the fruit during the
                Moorish period and today the province of Granada uses pomegranate as a charge in heraldry 
                for its canting arms.

                Spanish colonists later introduced the fruit to the Caribbean and America (Spanish America), but 
                in the English colonies, it was less at home: "Don't use the pomegranate inhospitably,
                a stranger that has come so far to pay his respects to thee," the English Quaker Peter Collinson 
                wrote to the botanizing John Bartram in Philadelphia, 1762. "Plant it against the side of 
                thy house, nail it close to the wall. In this manner it thrives wonderfully with us, and flowers 
                beautifully, and bears fruit this hot year. I have twenty-four on one tree... 
                Doctor Fothergill says, of all trees this is most salutiferous to mankind."

                The pomegranate had been introduced as an exotic to England the previous century, by John 
                Tradescant the elder, but the disappointment that it did not set fruit there led to its repeated
                introduction to the American colonies, even New England. It succeeded in the South: Bartram 
                received a barrel of pomegranates and oranges from a correspondent in Charleston, South Carolina, 1764. 
                John Bartram partook of "delitious" pomegranates with Noble Jones at Wormsloe Plantation, near Savannah,
                Georgia, in September 1765. Thomas Jefferson planted pomegranates at Monticello in 1771:
                he had them from George Wythe of Williamsburg. </p>
