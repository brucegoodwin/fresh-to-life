                <h2>Fresh Music - Meet Alicia Bruce, handclapper extraordinaire</h2>
                
                   <p><b>Have </b>you ever heard one hand clapping? No? Well meet Alicia Bruce, the musician behind the popular
                   handclapping song "Ashy Hands". She uses both of her hands and thensome to create the most innovative rock music out 
                   right now.
                   Here we ask her about what's fresh to her in her life, how her handclapping 
                   skills came to be, and what the future might hold.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <b>Fresh to Life:</b> We love this album! What inspired you to have an album of only handclapping? I mean, it's a little 
                 unusual, right?
                 
                 <br>
                 
                 <b>Alicia Bruce:</b> Hahaha! Yeah, I guess handclapping is a bit strange, no? I grew up in the South, where it's 
                 a common thing to clap to everything, so I guess you could call it second nature. I come from a looooong
                 line of handclappers, so I'm so happy to have my family on the album with me. 
                 
                 <br>
                 
                 <b>FTL:</b> So what about everything else? You seem to have such a great, positive vibe going on, how do you keep it up?
                 <br>
                 
                 <b>AB:</b> Aw thank you,baby! It's important to keep a positive vibe out here. There are folks, especially folks 
                 in the industry that wanna keep you down, they want you to work all the time for little pay and you have to stay focused.
                 I try to work with friends and family as much as I can so I won't really have to deal with "industry folks" and so far, 
                 it's paid off!
                 <br>
                 
                 <b>FTL:</b> We really, really love the album and love how you got artists that are guests on the record to step out 
                 of their comfort zone. I mean, Andre 3000 clapping and playing the sppons? Lordy, how was that even talked about?
                 
                 <br>
                 <b>AB:</b> Hahaa! Well Andre is a sweetie and I've known him since the Dungeon Family days in the 90's. He's always
                 asked to be on an album with me, so this album "Ashy Hands" was just perfect. I love that he sings to a different beat
                 than to what he was clapping. The spoon playing was so improptu and so needed! 
                 The studio had such good energy during the times we recorded. I love working with real creative folks.
                 
                 <b>FTL:</b> Oh, to be a fly on the wall! So what else other than your work keeps you Fresh to Life?
                 
                 <br>
                 
                 <b>AB:</b> Yeah, it was a good time. Hmmm, what else keeps me Fresh to Life? Good food, good people. A positive outlook. 
                 Knowing that if I mess up it's not the end of the world. I learned a long time ago
