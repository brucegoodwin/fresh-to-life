                <h2>Fresh Style - The Ultimate Throwback</h2>
                
                   <p>Everything old is new again, right? We see a lot of your lovely women rocking the 
                   best summer styles, including beautiful bright fabrics. These days it seems like we 
                   draw inspiration from all over the internet, from your phone and your desktop. Magazines seem like a thing
                   of the past, even though we all had subscriptions a few years ago!
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   When folks ask us where we get our style information from we say "The library!"! Really! Have you ever 
                   gone to your local library's online picture resource ? No? Well you should! Here in New York, we have
                   hundreds of thousands of images to gather our weekly style wrap ups. 
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   Images like the one above were found <a href="https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/">here</a>, the New York Public 
                   Library's Online Digital Collections. From there we do a quick searches or just peruse. You really don't know
                   what you'll find! From what we gather weekly we come up with our style guide, like the one above, which 
                   inspired us to talk about wraps last week.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   It's always great when we can incorporate an "ultimate throwback" to educate all of our "fresh folks"!
                   Tell us what ultimate style throwback you would like to see!
